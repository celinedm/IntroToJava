# IntroToJava

<h1>Road to Advancement in Java</h1>

<p>My name is Celine Del Mundo, I just recently graduated with a degree in Software Development. I'm going to be redoing most of the coding projects from Introduction to Java by Y. Daniel Liang. //n 
For my practice sakes, I want to be able to feel like I learned a lot from the last three years. I will commit to completing a coding problem per day. Although I will skill the easy 
"System.out.println("Hello World"); Method, as this is not what I will be practicing for.</p>
